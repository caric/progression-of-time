# progression-of-time
progression of time shows progress through your life, the year, the month, and the day.
I got this from the digital journaling in obsidian course at https://faithbasedproductivity.com/courses/ 
note: you'll need some css files from the course, too, to get this to work!

I modified it and incorporated it into my daily template so each daily note will have a progression which is frozen to that date.
